          <h4>The First Decade 1940- 1950</h4>
          <p>With regards to political activity Mumbai was at its forefront. The “Quit India” order to the British raj was given by Mahatma Gandhi in 1942 for this city. The world war came to an end in 1945 and India gained its independence in the year 1947. Trade was at its grass root level, it was only taking shape for the years to come. Traffic with regards of goods that needed transportation was being generated from the docks, Carnac Bunder, Wadi Bunder refineries, Cotton Textiles and Oil Mills. The need of transportation was being met by a handful of transporters/clearing agents that would source vehicles from the Military disposal. To over come these issues and to come up with a common approach to protect the personnel involved in the trade, Indravadan Oza, Ramnarayan Bhasin, Mangat Ram, Dharam Vir Ram Nath Chopra, Issak Adam, Chunilal Gupta, Pyara Singh Came together for the formation of what we know today as the Federation of Bombay Motor Transport Operators in the year 1940.</p>

          <h4>The Period of 1951-1970</h4>
          <p>This period experienced a boom in the number of transport companies within Mumbai City and its vicinity. Industrialization helped in higher productivity in the industries that led to higher amount of goods that needed transportation. A lot of new start-ups popped up in the period in Mumbai City and joint Stock Companies started services from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Assam. In The year 1955 Federation of Bombay motor Transport Operators was registered under the companies act. Government also took a step forward and formed the Mathadi Boards for various trades in this period.</p>

          <h4>The Period of 1971-1990</h4>
          <p>Mumbai was gushing with traffic a developing city was pooling in people with its ever increasing number of industries. Federation of Bombay Motor Transport Operators communicated the same to the government on every platform they could. Looking at the on start of the satellite port of Nhava-Sheva and Air Cargo complex at Sahar becoming fully functional drastic steps were needed suggested FBMTO. The appeal was responded to and the Trans Thane creek bridge opened, this created a new link between the Mumbai City & Navi Mumbai also its surrounding industrial area. The so called the main arteries of Mumbai the Eastern & the Western Express highways came up in this period as well which helped ease the burden of traffic in the city.</p>

          <h4>The Period of 1991-2000</h4>
          <p>This period was one of the most critical to the small motor transport operator. Challenges of untold dimension had stepped upon them all at once. FBMTO had to take up the role of an educator in this period which it still continues. The economy had opened up in this decade. Industry & Commerce was not only limited to local competition but to international players who had seen the potential of the Indian market. Mumbai was the known financial hub and hence attracted the most amount of competition. FBMTO started educating its members on how to compete with the global giants, introducing new technologies that were being used on a global scale. FBMTO also realized the movement of a number of transporters from Mumbai city to Navi Mumbai to make their operations cost effective and made plans to establish a base for its members in the near future.</p>

          <h4>The Period of 2001-2010</h4>
          <p>This Decade saw a further increase in competition, with lower entry barriers and easy availability of loans the industry of transportation was seen spinning on its head. Transportation became the largest direct and indirect employer after agriculture. The market conditions were good too; India was growing with 8% to 9% GDP. This growth again came with traffic jams and no entries for entry of heavy vehicles on city during peak hours. FBMTO once again communicated the same to the government & pointed out that earlier the GVW of vehicles was mere 5MT but now the market has been demanding for vehicles of 40 to 45 MT capacity and also how the earlier steps had helped the coexistence of city expansion and the transport fraternity. We experienced construction and reconstruction of a lot of roads, 4 lane highways were being constructed of world class standards. FBMTO is the first and pioneer association is Maharashtra formed in the year 1940 & registered in the year 1955 by small transporters to safeguard their interest. In the last 75 years of existence FBMTO was worked to its strength to make sure that its members receive only the best.</p>
          <p>FBMTO enters its 75th Grand year and shall celebrate its Diamond Jubilee on 24th October 2015.</p>
          <p>Federation of Bombay Motor Transport Operators (FBMTO) has grown by leaps and bounds to a membership strength of 1800 small transport operators plying to nearly 1,00,000 different types of commercial vehicles all over India. FBMTO is deeply involved with the problems and pitfall of the road transport industry. FBMTO takes pride in being an association that works by the rules and encourages all its members to follow rules/law.</p>
          <p>FBMTO is constantly working towards Educating, informing and updating its members with the latest rules and regulations and extends hands to authorities for co-operation in implementation of this rules/law.</p>
