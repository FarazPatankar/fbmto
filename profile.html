          <p>Federation of Bombay Motor Transport Operators (FBMTO) deals with the common problems of a small transport operator that he faces of a day to day basis. These problems that come up are taken up by the office bearers of FBMTO with concerned ministries and State/Central Govt. FBMTO looks after the grievances of its members and takes up their complaints with the concerned departments such as the BMC, labour Commissioner and Police/R.T.O.</p>
          <p>Time and time again FBMTO intervenes in matters of mal practices & dissolving them creating a win-win situation for the stake holders involved.</p>
          <p>FBMTO makes sure it stays connected with its members, as small motor transport operators do not have access to technology earlier all communication was sent out in written form but now in this new era of technology and smartphones FBMTO has come up with is own website www.fbmto.com which is the first mobile friendly website of its kind in the transport industry fraternity.</p>
          <p>FBMTO makes sure that the cry of the small transporter doesnâ€™t fall on deaf years and hence has its representation is the apex body of Transport the ALL INDIA MOTOR TRANSPORT CONGRESS, Delhi. Problems of small transporters are presented by the representatives in the meetings of AIMTC as well.</p>
